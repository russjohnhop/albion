# What is Albion?

Albion is a project using the Spotify API where a user can search for their favourite artist and see their albums displayed.

# Why did you decide to do this project?

I wanted to work on a project using React, Node, Vite and an API. I wanted to avoid libraries and anything 3rd party as much as possible so I could learn as much as possible by doing it myself. This is especially true for CSS, which I am still improving at. I'm passionate about music which made using the Spotify API an obvious choice. I found the subject matter made me more interested in the project, and it made it more rewarding when it started working.

# What challenges did you face while doing this project?

I learnt about the best build tools and development tools for React, reading many different threads and watching videos about Vite - which seems to be the standard now and best practice. Due to this I went with Vite. There was an option to use Typescript when scaffolding the project, I have heard that static typing is productive, but as I'm not familiar and don't want additional complexity in my project, I went with JavaScript.

I did the majority of a React course on a site called Scrimba. The experience was really valuable and involved a video course that I could click, edit and code within. I was amazed at the power of React and really enjoyed it, I got the majority of the way through and was confident I could use React in the way I needed to for my application. This turned out to be true. I am really excited at the prospect of using React in a real, more complex application in the future.

Authentication was challenging at first, I encountered countless "only valid bearer authentication" errors. After countless console.log statements I diagnosed the issue, one of my props was an object not a string. It was a string when it was passed to the component, but was an object when coming through as a prop. I also found the documentation challenging to read at first, but I did grasp it as my project developed.

Generally I used Bootstrap at a very basic level before doing this project, and I felt very uncomfortable and negative around the thought of having to do any CSS. I know that this is because I haven't learnt about it enough yet, I decided to learn about CSS grid from various sites online and YouTube videos by Kevin Powell. I found it surprisingly easy, it worked really well with React and the use of the map function.
